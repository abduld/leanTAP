leanTAP: A Theorem Prover for First-Order Classical Logic
=========================================================

The goal of this project is to implement leanTap in
clojure.core.logic.nominal closely following the alphaleanTAP
implementation described in _alphaleanTAP: A Declarative Theorem Prover
for First-Order Classical
Logic_([PDF](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~webyrd/alphaleantap/alphatap.pdf))
and chapter of 10 of
[William Byrd](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~webyrd/)'s thesis
([PDF](http://gradworks.umi.com/3380156.pdf)).

The `alphaleantap` directory contains the original implementation in
Scheme.
